I have read your requirements carefully and understand what you want to do
I readed your requirements carefully so I think you need a man like this basically:
- one person could read your requirements carefully and could understand your means totally or be able to communicate in time, then you could communicate more efficiently and skillfully
- one person could design a good component architecture for your requirements and provide performance components which have considered details about logic and ui 
- one person could write test code for component and follow your spec for easily maintaince
- one person could optimize the code when he encounters mess code
- maybe one person like to write good component and finally solve your issue
- maybe one person be able to help you write backend code with good logic and better understanding
