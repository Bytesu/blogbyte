Hello everyone

I am Jonas.Su from China. It's my honor to talk with you.

I am a freelancer who just focus on React development with 8 years experience. 

I have 8+ years experience with React development.

I experienced many projects/products with React,  
-  Norna analysis platform(https://www.norna.ai/), one Sweden Company's Product is focusing on providing analysis service for retail vendor
- Famulei (https://famulei.us/). one product focus on providing AT&T suite for overseas student
- VegoGarden(https://vegogarden.com/) one store I am maintaining in U.S.A
- 

so I could make high effient work with React. and what I am good at are React component.
With component we could do many work effiently in a limit time. so components are the foundation things that need to make well.

so I do it with below steps:

- firstly I need to prepare foundation work, kind of seting up storybook, test environment,organizing nessary directory
- secondly Iâ€™d like to understand requirements detailly by reading the provoded description, file or commminuating with person who are related with my work.
- then I need to check user interface is right or not and then analysis spliting things from big to small, I think that's a good step, by doing this step. I could find out necessary prepartion advanctly, keep on refactoring and designing component which keep components archtecture is reasonable 
- before I write one component, I'd like to design how I test it firstly, I mean the main test cases. write component with good good logic and keep well understantding code with necessary comment. in progress what am I caring are keeping less render callback, simple code, changable input and reliable output, well understanding logic, easily test, also reasonable naming when I am developing. as long as I have implemented the commponent, I need to archieve unit test for the main case designed previously. then adjusting details according to requirements and design that provided to me ,including optimization of response speed which the real user interact with. I like the progress and these steps.  and for that time I think I basically finish development of one component.
