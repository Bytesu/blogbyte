greeting 问侯

in some cases[在某些情况下], yes. the firm handshake a North American expects may seem quite aggressive  in other places [北美人期望的坚定的握手在其他地方可能看起来相当激进]

In what ways can hand gestures lead to misunderstanding?

Well, as an example, we assume all people indicate the numbers one to ten with their fingers the same way. But in fact, they don't. While North American usually use an index finger for "one", most Europeans use a thumb. North American extend all ten fingers for "ten", However, Chinese indicate the numbers one to ten all on one hand. for example, an extended thumb and pinkie means "six", and a fist means "ten". Imagine how confusing this can be when you're trying to communicate quantities and prices with your hands.

what other gestures can cause confusion?

Take the gesture for "come here", for example. In North America, people gesture with the palm up, in southern Europe, that gesture means "good bye"! And in many Asian countries, the palm-up gesture is considerd rude. Instead, people there gesture with the palm down.

I've heared that, in Japan, poiting with the index finger is not polite. is that right?

Yes, Japanese prefer to point with the palm open and facing up.

Surely there must be some gestures used everywhere, right? what about the thumbs-up sign for "great"?

Sorry, That's extremely rude in Australia and the Middle East. This is why it's so important to be aware of these cultural differences.
