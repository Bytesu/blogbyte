A little while ago  刚/方才

bubble [ˈbʌbl]   n. 泡;气泡;肥皂泡;(欲表达的)一点感情 vi. 起泡;冒泡;(移动时)发出冒泡的声音;洋溢着(某种感情)

Keep an eye out for [留意;瞪大眼睛;密切注意]

A little while ago I was given a cool design for an Instagram story styled bubble component where each bubble would smoothly slide into its new position when we got its new order from the API.

I honestly just wanted a copy paste solution that I wouldn’t have to tweak too much [老实说，我只是想要一个拷贝粘贴解决方案，我不需要调整太多]

I also didn’t want to bring in some huge, usually overly flexible package to reorder one small thing[我也不想引入一些庞大的、通常过于灵活的软件包来重新排序一件小事]
