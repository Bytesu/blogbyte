Firstly  I choose the knife , knife  is a very usefull staff .  it could help cut   when you get some hard food .  you can use it protect yourself avoiding hurt by small dangerous.
the magnifying glass is the second choice , you could make a fire using magnify glass to focus the sunlight.
then you could cook food that you find. and the cooked food  could helpfull for nutrition(身体所需营养) for the body. you could have more chance to survive in outside when your body gets enough replenishment. then you could have enough energy to find the nessery water for live,build shelter from the wind and rain.
