Geneva is the only place I’ve been in Switzerland[ˈswitsə(r)ˌlənd] and it didn’t leave me very impressed.
My friends and I went there for a weekend getaway from Paris, although we hardly spent any time in the city itself as we crossed back into France to visit nearby Chamonix[ˈtʃæmənɪks][夏蒙尼（地名，法国小镇，是阿尔卑斯山脉的典型山城] to snowboard instead.
But from the brief time we did spend in Geneva, I didn’t really like it. It’s Switzerland’s financial hub, and so the city felt very corporate and bland. It’s also not as pretty or scenic as I was expecting (aside from a few cute streets like the one pictured above.)
And it’s by far THE most expensive place I’ve ever been on my travels. I’m pretty sure I paid the equivalent of $15 for a basic veggie sandwich at a food hall there.
However, I definitely want to return to Switzerland one day and visit many other parts of the country. I would just skip Geneva the next time I’m there!
I’ve visited quite a few cities in the US (my home city of New York, Boston, DC, Philadelphia, Chicago, LA…) and I have to say out of all of them, Seattle is one of my least favorites.
Due to having some family there, I’ve actually been to Seattle several times but I’ve never really clicked with(合拍) the city any time I’ve been. I want to like it, but something about it just isn’t for me.
If you’re really into outdoorsy activities, it’s a great place to live. There are plenty of mountains and national parks you can day trip to. But the city itself is underwhelming(无法感受的) and bland to me. And it doesn’t help that the weather is so often rainy and overcast.
I’ve also been there twice at Christmas and been let down by how un-festive the city feels. Then again, nothing compares to Christmas in New York…


Another strike against the Pacific Northwest from me goes to Vancouver. As a whole, I just don’t think I really like this region. I visited Vancouver on a weekend trip from Seattle.
Just a few hours from Seattle by train, I was excited to visit one of my Canadian friends I’d met while studying abroad. While it was good to see her, I was not very enamored with Vancouver itself.
Like Seattle, it was dreary and rainy most of the time I was there. It did clear up some on my last day, and I took a long walk around the scenic waterfront Stanley Park (pictured below) but I still wasn’t sad to leave and I’m in no hurry to return.
Something about the city just didn’t click with me. I also had the worst customs experience of my life entering AND leaving Canada with the rudest border agents I’ve encountered anywhere. So much for the stereotype of Canadians being friendly and welcoming!



London is a city that I think I COULD really love, but I just haven’t spent enough time there or done the right things on any of the times I’ve visited yet.
I’ve been to London a few times now, most recently at the start of an England road trip, and I preferred the English countryside so much compared to being in the city.
London seems like the type of big city I should like (since I love New York and Paris so much) but it has just never clicked for me. Some of it might be due to it being such a large city that it can feel underwhelming, and I’ve only ever spent a couple days there at a time.
That being said, I’ll definitely return to London in the future, and hopefully click with it more!
