Geneva [dʒəˈnivə] is the only place I’ve been in Switzerland[ˈswitsə(r)ˌlənd] and it didn’t leave me very impressed.
My friends and I went there for a weekend getaway from Paris, although we hardly spent any time in the city itself as we crossed back into France to visit nearby Chamonix[ˈtʃæmənɪks][夏蒙尼（地名，法国小镇，是阿尔卑斯山脉的典型山城] to snowboard instead.
But from the brief time we did spend in Geneva, I didn’t really like it. It’s Switzerland’s financial hub, and so the city felt very corporate and bland. It’s also not as pretty or scenic[ˈsiːnɪk][风景优美的;舞台布景的] as I was expecting (aside from a few cute[kjuːt][可爱的;漂亮迷人的;有性吸引力的;性感的;精明的;机灵的] streets like the one pictured above.)
And it’s by far the most expensive place I’ve ever been on my travels. I’m pretty sure I paid the equivalent[ɪˈkwɪvələnt][adj.相等的;(价值、数量、意义、重要性等)相同的 n.相等的东西;等量;对应词] of $15 for a basic veggie[ˈvedʒi][蔬菜] sandwich at a food hall there.
However, I definitely want to return to Switzerland one day and visit many other parts of the country. I would just skip Geneva the next time I’m there!
I’ve visited quite a few cities in the US (my home city of New York, Boston, DC, Philadelphia [ˌfɪləˈdɛlfiə][费拉德尔菲亚,费城], Chicago [ʃəˈkɑˌgoʊ] [芝加哥（在美国中西部；为美国第二大城], LA…) and I have to say out of all of them, Seattle[siˈætəl][西雅图
] is one of my least favorites.
Due to having some family there, I’ve actually been to Seattle several times but I’ve never really clicked with[合拍] the city any time I’ve been. I want to like it, but something about it just isn’t for me.
If you’re really into outdoorsy activities, it’s a great place to live. There are plenty of mountains and national parks you can day trip to. But the city itself is underwhelming [ˌʌndərˈwelmɪŋ][adj.不起眼的;平庸的;索然无味的] and bland[blænd][adj. 平淡的;乏味的;清淡的;无滋味的;沉稳的;无动于衷的;讲话枯燥的]  to me. And it doesn’t help that the weather is so often rainy and overcast [ˌoʊvərˈkæst][n.阴天;[气象学]阴;遮盖物(尤指云、雾等);郁闷;忧愁;沮丧;[采矿]风桥 adj.阴暗的;阴天的;多云的].
I’ve also been there twice at Christmas and been let down by how un-festive the city feels. Then again, nothing compares to Christmas in New York…


Another strike against the Pacific [pəˈsɪfɪk][n.太平洋 adj.太平洋里的;与太平洋有关的] Northwest from me goes to Vancouver[vænˈkuːvər][温哥华（1．加拿大西南部一城市；2．美国华盛顿州西南部一城市）]. As a whole, I just don’t think I really like this region. I visited Vancouver on a weekend trip from Seattle.
Just a few hours from Seattle by train, I was excited[ɪkˈsaɪtɪd]  to visit one of my Canadian friends I’d met while studying abroad. While it was good to see her, I was not very enamored [ɛˈnæmərd][使倾心，使迷恋] with Vancouver itself.
Like Seattle, it was dreary[ˈdrɪri][令人沮丧的;沉闷的;枯燥无味的] and rainy most of the time I was there. It did clear up some on my last day, and I took a long walk around the scenic waterfront[ˈwɔːtərfrʌnt][滨水路;滨水区;码头区] Stanley[ˈstænli][斯坦利
] Park (pictured below) but I still wasn’t sad to leave and I’m in no hurry to return.
Something about the city just didn’t click with me. I also had the worst customs experience of my life entering and leaving Canada with the rudest[ˈrudəst][adj.粗鲁的;无礼的;粗野的;猥亵的;下流的;突然的;突如其来的;猛烈的 rude的最高级] border agents I’ve encountered anywhere. So much for the stereotype[ˈsteriətaɪp][n.模式化观念(或形象);老一套;刻板印象 vt. 对…形成模式化(或类型化)的看法] of Canadians being friendly and welcoming!



London is a city that I think I could really love, but I just haven’t spent enough time there or done the right things on any of the times I’ve visited yet.
I’ve been to London[ˈlʌndən] a few times now, most recently at the start of an England road trip, and I preferred [prɪˈfɜːrd]  the English countryside so much compared to being in the city.
London seems like the type of big city I should like (since I love New York and Paris so much) but it has just never clicked for me. Some of it might be due to it being such a large city that it can feel underwhelming, and I’ve only ever spent a couple days there at a time.
That being said, I’ll definitely return to London in the future, and hopefully click with it more!
