Haroun[哈罗恩] Tazieff[塔齐耶夫], the Polish[ˈpoʊlɪʃ][n. 波兰语 adj. 波兰的;波兰人的;波兰语的;波兰文化的] scientist [ˈsaɪəntɪst] [科学家], has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes [vɑlˈkeɪnoʊz][火山]  and deep caves [keɪvz][山洞;洞穴 v.（使）塌陷;倒塌;屈服;洞穴潜水]  in all parts of the world. In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu[基伍湖] in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro[基图罗]. Tazieff was able to set up his camp[kæmp] [n. 营地;度假营;(尤指政府让人长时间住宿的)营房，营帐 vi. 宿营;露营;(尤指在假日)野营;借住;借宿;暂住 adj.故意带女子气的，女性化的(被某些人认为是典型同性恋的特征);夸张的，滑稽可笑的(尤指故逗笑);做作的] very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet[ˈkwaɪət] [adj.轻声的;轻柔的;安静的;僻静的;寂静的;清静的;平静的;恬静的 n. 宁静;寂静;平静;安静 v. (使)平静，安静] and he was able to return two days later. This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures [ˈtɛmprətʃərz] [温度;气温;体温]. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.
